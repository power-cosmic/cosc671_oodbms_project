Database

The database of choice to be represented here is going to be a simplified version of Power Cosmic's Fog.

Fog is a:
  - game playing system
  - game distribution platform
  - forum

all rolled into one.

There are three types of users for Fog: FogUsers, Developers, and Administrators. All three of them are able to communicate using the forum.

FogUsers and Developers interact with the game distribution platform. Developers create, upload, and sell their developed games. FogUsers search for and can purchase games hosted on Fog.

FogUsers can play the video games that have been purchased on the game distribution platform.

Games are all developed in JavaScript, raw information of which is stored as a JSON file. Player information per game is recorded, along with card reward information.
